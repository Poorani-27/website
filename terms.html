        These payment terms and conditions, including the terms, policies, guidelines and instructions referred to herein, (“Payment Terms and Conditions”) and the general terms and conditions governing your access to our services (“General Terms and Conditions”) constitute a legal agreement between PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (R.C.S. Luxembourg B 118 349), a duly licenced Luxembourg credit institution under the prudential supervision of the Luxembourg financial sector authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, (“we”, “our” or “us”) and you, the sole trader, company or other business entity having created an account with us (the “Merchant”, “you” or “your”), governing your access to and use of our payment processing services provided under the Zettle by PayPal brand (together, the “Payment Service”).
        By creating a Zettle Account (defined below) you accept and agree to comply with these Payment Terms and Conditions.<br> If you do not agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions (or if you do not have the right to bind the company or other business entity you are representing), you are not permitted to access or use the Payment Service.

        It is important that you understand the risks and liabilities associated with the use of the Payment Service, and you should read these Payment Terms and Conditions carefully before agreeing to them and before you start using the Payment Service.
